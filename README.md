ankisyncd
=========

[Anki][] is a powerful open source flashcard application, which helps you
quickly and easily memorize facts over the long term utilizing a spaced
repetition algorithm. Anki's main form is a desktop application (for Windows,
Linux and macOS) which can sync to a web version (AnkiWeb) and mobile
versions for Android and iOS.

This is a personal Anki server, which you can sync against instead of
AnkiWeb. It was originally developed to support the flashcard functionality
on Bibliobird, a web application for language learning.

This version is a fork of [jdoe0/ankisyncd](https://github.com/jdoe0/ankisyncd).
It supports Python 3 and Anki 2.1.

Installing
----------

0. Install Anki. The currently supported version range is 2.1.1ã€œ2.1.7. (Keep in
   mind this range only applies to the Anki used by the server, clients can be
   as old as 2.0.27 and still work.) Running the server with other versions might
   work as long as they're not 2.0.x, but things might break, so do it at your
   own risk. If for some reason you can't get the supported Anki version easily
   on your system, you can use `anki-bundled` from this repo:

        $ git submodule update --init
        $ cd anki-bundled
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

   Keep in mind `pyaudio`, a dependency of Anki, requires Python 3 and PortAudio
   headers to be present before running `pip`. If you can't or don't want to
   install these, you can try [patching Anki](#running-ankisyncd-without-pyaudio).

1. Install the dependencies:

        $ pip install webob

2. Modify ankisyncd.conf according to your needs

3. Create user:

        $ ./ankisyncctl.py adduser <username>

4. Run ankisyncd:

        $ python -m ankisyncd

Installing (Docker)
-------------------

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kuklinistvan/docker-anki-sync-server#usage).

Setting up Anki
---------------

### Anki 2.1

Create a new directory in [the add-ons folder][addons21] (name it something
like ankisyncd), create a file named `__init__.py` containing the code below
and put it in the `ankisyncd` directory.

    import anki.sync, anki.hooks, aqt

    addr = "http://127.0.0.1:27701/" # put your server address here
    anki.sync.SYNC_BASE = "%s" + addr
    def resetHostNum():
        aqt.mw.pm.profile['hostNum'] = None
    anki.hooks.addHook("profileLoaded", resetHostNum)

### Anki 2.0

Create a file (name it something like ankisyncd.py) containing the code below
and put it in `~/Anki/addons`.

    import anki.sync

    addr = "http://127.0.0.1:27701/" # put your server address here
    anki.sync.SYNC_BASE = addr
    anki.sync.SYNC_MEDIA_BASE = addr + "msync/"

### AnkiDroid

Advanced -> Custom sync server

Sync url: `http://your.server:27701`
Media sync url: `http://your.server:27701/msync`

Make sure to not use https, no trailing slashes and include the port. You'll be asked to login again, the email is the username (no full email necessary).

Running `ankisyncd` without `pyaudio`
-------------------------------------

`ankisyncd` doesn't use the audio recording feature of Anki, so if you don't
want to install PortAudio, you can edit `anki-bundled/anki/sound.py` and
`anki-bundled/requirements.txt` to exclude `pyaudio`:

`ed` version:

    $ echo '/# Packaged commands/,$d;w' | tr ';' '\n' | ed anki/sound.py
    $ echo '/^pyaudio/d;w' | tr ';' '\n' | ed requirements.txt

`sed -i` version:

    $ sed -i '/# Packaged commands/,$d' anki/sound.py
    $ sed -i '/^pyaudio/d' requirements.txt

Manual version: remove every line past "# Packaged commands" in anki/sound.py,
remove every line starting with "pyaudio" in requirements.txt
